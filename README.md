# Footballers' birthmonths

Simple project to see how birthdays of famous football players are distributed in a calendar year. Malcolm Gladwell in his book Outliers writes how people born early in the year have an advantage over people who are born late in the year. I like football so I wanted to see if this hypothesis by Gladwell has any merit. The dataset is quite limited (280 players) and the dataset is from 2018 so no real conclusions can be drawn from this data. 

Contains a Python script to scrape the data from an article and save to .csv file. Data analysis and visualization done using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.
